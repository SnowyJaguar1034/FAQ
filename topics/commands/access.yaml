title: How do I let people reply to tickets?
content: |
  To allow people to respond to tickets they need to have a access role. You can set these with the `=accessrole <role mention|role id|role name>` command. You can set up to 10 different access roles. If a role you are adding by name has a space in the name then you need to wrap the name in `" "` e.g. `=accessrole "Staff Team"`.
