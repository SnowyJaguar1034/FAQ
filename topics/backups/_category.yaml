  Backups are used to **save or duplicate your server**. 
  They are linked to the user that created it, but not limited to a server. That means you can use backups to move, or duplicate a server.

  Backups can contain channels, roles, server settings and even messages, bans, nicknames and role assignments if you have premium.
