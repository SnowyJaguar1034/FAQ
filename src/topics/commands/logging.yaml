title: How do I manage my logging channel?
subtitle: How to toggle the logging channel on and off and move it to a different channel
content: |
  via the =logging command, you can recreate, change and disable the logging channel. If your logging channel was deleted, run =logging to disable it and then re-enable it, which should re-create the channel. If you want to use an existing channel, disable logging by running =logging once. Then run =logging #channel_name to re-enable logging and to send logs to an already existing channel of your choice.
