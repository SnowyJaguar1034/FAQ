title: Why isn't the bot responding to my commands?
content: |
  Please check the following before asking for help:
  • The bot has Read Messages, Send Messages, and Embed Links permissions.
  • You are using the correct prefix. Use @ModMail prefix to check the prefix.
  • The command you are using is valid. Check using =help <command>.
  • The bot is online. Discord might be having issues, or the bot might be restarting.
