title: How do I ping people when a ticket is opened?
content: |
  To inform people when new tickets are opened they need to have a ping role. You can set these with the `=pingrole <role mention|role id|role name>` command. You can set up to 10 different ping roles. If a role you are adding by name has a space in the name then you need to wrap the name in `" "` e.g. `=pingrole "Staff Team"`.
