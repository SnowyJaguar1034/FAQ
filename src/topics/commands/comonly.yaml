title: How do I force my staff to reply via commands?
content: |
    Enable command only mode. You can do so by running `=commandonly`. Once in command only mode, staff members can only send a reply to the users by using the `=reply <message>` command. If they want to reply anonymously, they will need to use `=areply <message>`.
