  To make your staff members appear as anonymous, you can use the `=anonymous` toggle command. Note that this will only work on messages sent normally without the use of commands. If you want an anonymous reply via commands, use `=areply`. As for making a member's messages anonymous,  there's no way to do that as this would be too exploitable.
