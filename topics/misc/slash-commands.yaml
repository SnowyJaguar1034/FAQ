title: Slash Commands don't show up
subtitle: I received "Seems like your tried to use Xenon with Slash Commands"
content: |
  Make sure you have actually invited Xenon and that you have **Slash Commands enabled** in your Discord settings. This setting can be found in the "Text & Images" category.
  If commands still don't show up for you, try to restart your Discord client and check for updates in the App Store.
